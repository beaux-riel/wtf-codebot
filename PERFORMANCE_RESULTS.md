## Implementation Details

### 1. Performance Profiler (`wtf_codebot.performance.profiler`)

**Features Implemented:**
- Real-time memory usage monitoring with timeline tracking
- CPU utilization monitoring with configurable sampling intervals
- Memory allocation tracing using Python's `tracemalloc`
- Function decorators for seamless integration
- Profile result management and statistical analysis

**Key Capabilities:**
```python
# Example usage
profiler = PerformanceProfiler(sample_interval=0.1)

@profiler.profile_function
def analyze_code():
    # Your analysis code
    pass

# Results include duration, peak memory, CPU usage, and timelines
```

### 2. Intelligent Caching (`wtf_codebot.performance.cache`)

**Architecture:**
- **Memory Cache**: Fast LRU cache for immediate access

**Scalability Results:**
- Linear scaling with CPU core count for I/O-bound operations
- Optimal performance with 2-4 processes for typical codebases
- Memory usage scales linearly with process count
- Significant benefits for projects with 50+ files

### 4. Comprehensive Benchmarking (`wtf_codebot.performance.benchmarks`)

**Testing Framework:**
- Automated benchmark suite with synthetic and real projects
- Performance metric collection (CPU, memory, throughput)
- Statistical analysis and recommendation generation
- CLI tool for easy performance testing

**Benchmark Categories:**
- Sequential vs parallel processing comparison
- Cache performance analysis
- Memory usage profiling
- Throughput measurements across project sizes

profiler = PerformanceProfiler()
profiler.start_monitoring()

# Your code here
result = analyze_codebase(project_path)

profile_result = profiler.stop_monitoring()
