## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ 
- Poetry for dependency management
- Git for version control
- Docker (optional, for testing containerized features)

### Setup

```bash
# Install Poetry if you haven't already
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Clone and setup the project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wtf-codebot.git
cd wtf-codebot

# Install dependencies including development tools
poetry install --with dev

# Install pre-commit hooks for code quality
poetry run pre-commit install

# Set up environment variables for testing
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Anthropic API key for testing
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=wtf_codebot --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Run specific test files
poetry run pytest tests/test_performance.py

# Run tests with verbose output
poetry run pytest -v

# Run only fast tests (excluding slow integration tests)
poetry run pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Code Quality Tools

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
poetry run black wtf_codebot/ tests/
poetry run isort wtf_codebot/ tests/

# Lint code
poetry run flake8 wtf_codebot/
poetry run mypy wtf_codebot/

# Security scan
poetry run bandit -r wtf_codebot/

# Check dependencies for vulnerabilities
poetry run safety check

# Run all quality checks
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## üìã Types of Contributions

### üîç New Language Analyzers

We welcome analyzers for new programming languages. To add a new language analyzer:

   from .base import BaseAnalyzer
   
   class NewLanguageAnalyzer(BaseAnalyzer):
       def analyze(self, file_content: str, file_path: str) -> List[Finding]:
           # Implementation here
           pass
   ```

2. **Register the analyzer** in `wtf_codebot/analyzers/registry.py`

3. **Add language-specific patterns** if needed

4. **Write comprehensive tests**

5. **Update documentation**

### üé® New Output Formats

To add a new output format:

1. **Create a reporter** in `wtf_codebot/reporters/`
2. **Implement the base reporter interface**
3. **Add format option to CLI**
4. **Add tests and documentation**

### üîó New Integrations

For external service integrations:

1. **Create integration** in `wtf_codebot/integrations/`
2. **Follow the base integration pattern**
3. **Add configuration options**
4. **Include authentication handling**
5. **Add comprehensive tests**

### üìä Enhanced Reporting

For improving reports and visualizations:

1. **Update HTML templates** in `templates/`
2. **Enhance JSON schema** if needed
3. **Add new chart types or visualizations**
4. **Ensure responsive design**

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Performance Tests**: Test performance characteristics
4. **CLI Tests**: Test command-line interfaces
5. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows

### Writing Tests

```python
# Example test structure
import pytest
from wtf_codebot.analyzers.python_analyzer import PythonAnalyzer

class TestPythonAnalyzer:
    def setup_method(self):
        self.analyzer = PythonAnalyzer()
    
    def test_analyze_simple_function(self):
        code = """
        def hello_world():
            print("Hello, World!")
        """
        findings = self.analyzer.analyze(code, "test.py")
        assert len(findings) == 0  # No issues expected
    
    @pytest.mark.slow
    def test_analyze_large_file(self):
        # Test with large files (marked as slow)
        pass
```

### Test Data

- Use realistic test data when possible
- Create fixtures for common test scenarios
- Mock external APIs and services
- Use parametrized tests for multiple scenarios

## üìù Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes
- **Type hints**: Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic, not obvious code

```python
def analyze_code(file_path: str, options: AnalysisOptions) -> List[Finding]:
    """Analyze a source code file for issues and patterns.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the source code file to analyze
        options: Configuration options for the analysis
    
    Returns:
        List of findings discovered during analysis
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified file doesn't exist
        AnalysisError: If analysis fails due to invalid code
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### User Documentation

- **README**: Keep README.md up to date with new features
- **CLI Help**: Update help text for new commands and options
- **Examples**: Provide realistic examples for new features
- **Guides**: Create guides for complex features

## üîí Security Considerations

### Security Guidelines

1. **Never commit secrets** or API keys
2. **Validate all inputs** to prevent injection attacks
3. **Use secure defaults** for configuration options
4. **Handle errors gracefully** without exposing sensitive information
5. **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web-related features
